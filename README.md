# Web Scrapping - Books website
Technologies used: python, beautiful soup, pandas

From a website, containing a set of books and it`s informations, I used Beautiful Soup to try to extract data from the website and pandas to create a dataset and transform the data with all books informations.

## Python file
This python code first gathers each book`s link and then, extracts the necessary information.
After that, load the information in a pandas dataframe and manipulate the values.
## Output
The output is a csv file containing the extracted data.
